# Pull request review checklist üìù ‚úÖ

This is a checklist that helps conduct a pull request review properly. These points are required to merge the PR

- [ ] There are no merge conflicts

- [ ] The pull request is named accordingly (description of the functionality - it
   will be visible in the changelog later)
   
- [ ] Every task requirement (from Jira) is done

- [ ] The app runs, it boots up properly (e.g. no syntax errors)

- [ ] The proposed functionality is working properly (you need to pull this branch
   and check for yourself)

- [ ] Each function, class or functionality is properly documented
   (short description of what it does, parameters or return values if they need
   any explanation)
